Connect Four Game

Step 1: Planning

-- What HTML would be useful for the board game? --
It would be helpful to have an HTML table with 7 td's across and 6 tr's down.
Also want a tr above everything to let players click to drop a piece.
Would be nice to have a header tag for a nice title.
Also need a div for a scoreboard if we want to keep track of multiple games.
A button would be handy in order to allow the user to start a new game.

-- How could you represent a played piece in the HTML board? --
Each td could have 3 different classes: blank, red, and blue.
We could use CSS to make these 3 different classes display accordingly.

-- In JavaScript, what would be a good structure for the in-memory game board? --
An array of arrays (2d array) would be an appropriate data structure to represent the board.
We could choose values (0,1,2) to represent blank, red, and blue states

-- What might the game flow be? --
The game starts by initializing the board to be completely blank.
The game waits for a click event on the input tr (top row).
Once a click happens, a piece is dropped in that column and the board is updated.
The game then checks to see if someone has won (4 pieces in a row).
If there is a winner, an alert is thrown. If not the next player becomes the "active turn" and the game continues.
If the board fills up completely without a winner, then a tie should be declared.

Useful functions:
initializeBoard();
dropPiece(color, col);
findOpenCell(board, col);
updateBoard(board, cellRow, cellCol);
checkForWinner(board);
checkForTie(board);
